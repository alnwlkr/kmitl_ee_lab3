# Electrical Engineering Laboratory 3 Repository  

This repository contains MATLAB scripts used for calculations and plotting in laboratory reports. All files are compatible with MATLAB R2024a.  

## High Voltage Laboratory: Study of Electric Field Characteristics  

This experiment explores uniform and non-uniform electric fields and their effect on breakdown voltage.  

The provided script (Q3.m) creates a plot showing the relationship between breakdown voltage and the distance between electrodes. The plot compares three different types of electrodes in a single figure.  

## Induction Motor Laboratory  

This experiment studies the following topics:  
1. Methods to determine the equivalent circuit parameters of a 3-phase induction motor using:  
   - No-load test  
   - Blocked rotor test  
   - VI method  

2. The relationship between load torque and the following parameters of an induction motor:  
   - Input current  
   - Slip  
   - Input power  
   - Power factor (while applying a mechanical load)  

The script in this repository will plot a relationship between
- (p21.m) $Theoretical Input Current ($I_{i/p}$) \& Output Torque Relationship ($T_{o/p}$)$
- (p22.m) $Theoretical Slip (s) \& Output Torque Relationship ($T_{o/p}$)$
- (p23.m) $Theoretical Input Power Factor ($PF_{i/p}$) \& Output Torque Relationship ($T_{o/p}$)$
- (p31.m) $Practical Input Current ($I_{i/p}$) \& Output Torque Relationship ($T_{o/p,pulley}$)$
- (p32.m) $Practical Slip (s) \& Output Torque Relationship ($T_{o/p,pulley}$)$
- (p33.m) $Practical Input Power Factor ($PF_{i/p}$) \& Output Torque Relationship ($T_{o/p,pulley}$)$
